# Unity Editor Programming

After watching [the tutorial](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/unity-editor-extending-custom-windows), I got more curious about the Unity's GUI and Editor features and how far I can extend it. I just can say WOW. It is amazing, how much free I am to use the tools and features it provides to create my own plugin.



### Final Result
The plugin covers:
- Defining the initial position, rotation, scale, color & name
- Create a shape by random, base on defined parameters
- Create multiple shapes w/ offset over X, Y or Z
